Some usefull c++ stuff.

## Packages

- std : *no dependency* - a set of containers, strings, stream manipulators, etc. that could almost belong to c++ standard library.

- physics : *no dependency* - to work with strongly typed arithmetic values representing physic meatures (for instance not to add a length and a duration).

- hash : *requires std* - hash related features (for instance string_id to obtain a compile-time integer-like object from a string literal).

- type : *requires hash & std* - to dynamic types utilities (for instance to create them from some register identifier).
